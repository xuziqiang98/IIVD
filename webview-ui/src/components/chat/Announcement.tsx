You must update the latestAnnouncementId in ClineProvider for new announcements to show to users.

As soon as an announcement is shown, the id will be updated in state. This ensures that announcements are not shown more than once, even if the user doesn't close it themselves.

				We're thrilled to announce that our experimental Checkpoints feature is now enabled by default for all
				users. This powerful feature automatically tracks your project changes during a task, allowing you to
				quickly review or revert to earlier states if needed.
			</p>

			<h3 style={{ margin: "12px 0 8px" }}>What's New</h3>
			<p style={{ margin: "5px 0px" }}>
				Automatic Checkpoints provide you with:
				<ul style={{ margin: "4px 0 6px 20px", padding: 0 }}>
					<li>Peace of mind when making significant changes</li>
					<li>Ability to visually inspect changes between steps</li>
					<li>Easy rollback if you're not satisfied with certain code modifications</li>
					<li>Improved navigation through complex task execution</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h3 style={{ margin: "12px 0 8px" }}>Customize Your Experience</h3>
			<p style={{ margin: "5px 0px" }}>
				While we recommend keeping this feature enabled, you can disable it if needed.{" "}
